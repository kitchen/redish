This is a redis-like key value server written in golang and accessed via grpc.

I may end up making it accessible through other means (like a standard RESTful interface) at some point.

This really shouldn't be used by anyone, it's just an experimental thing so I can learn me some golang and gRPC since $PROBABLE_NEW_EMPLOYER uses golang and gRPC :)
